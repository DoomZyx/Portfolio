 "about-me-text": "Hello! My name is Axel Cella, a junior web developer. Previously, I worked as an automotive parts consultant, which allowed me to develop excellent skills in organization, active listening, and interpersonal relations. After much reflection, I decided to pursue a career change into web developmentâ€”a field that had interested me for years. I began a training course as a web integrator at OpenClassrooms. After obtaining my certification, I now wish to further train in back-end technologies, and I continue to work and learn every day on my PC with motivation, enthusiasm, and plenty of ideas.",
